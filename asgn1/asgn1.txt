2) When selecting a laptop for gaming, video editing, and graphic design, Iâ€™d prioritize a powerful CPU (Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9), a dedicated GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3060 or better), 16-32 GB of RAM, and at least 512 GB of SSD storage. A high-resolution display with accurate color and good cooling are also essential.
